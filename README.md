# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Project Description
This project is my foundational step into the world of Data Science and Machine Learning. The goal is to build a model that can classify the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. This demonstrates my ability to implement a complete machine learning workflow.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Pandas (for data manipulation)
* Scikit-learn (for model building)
* Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Results
The classification models developed achieved an accuracy of over 97% on the test dataset, successfully distinguishing between the three Iris species.
